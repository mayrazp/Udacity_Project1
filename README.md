# I. Definition

1. Project Overview
Airbnb is a website that allows communication between tourists who love to travel and property owners. The great advantage of the service offered by Airbnb is the direct communication with the host, meeting any special request the guest may eventually need.
The site collects a large amount of information about the host, their properties and allows the visitors to leave a review about the service offered by the host.
The hosting option offered by Airbnb aims to satisfy the customer’s needs for them to come back again.
For this project, I was interested in exploring the Airbnb dataset from Boston and answer some business questions.
