## Project Motivation

For this project, I was interested in exploring the Airbnb dataset from Oakland to better understand the following questions:
1.   What we can say about customer’s feelings in the reviews posted after staying in an Airbnb Oakland house/apartment?.
2.   What is the sentiment analysis of customer review grouped by neighborhood?
3.   Which topics were most commented on in the customer review? Listed the words for each topic

## Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here]
